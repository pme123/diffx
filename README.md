Pretty diffs for case classes. 

The library is published for Scala 2.12 and 2.13.

## Goals of the project

- human-readable case class diffs
- support for popular testing frameworks
- OTB collections support
- OTB non-case class support
- smaller compilation overhead compared to shapless based solutions (thanks to magnolia <3)
- programmer friendly and type safe api for partial ignore

## Scalatest integration

To use with scalatest, add the following dependency:

```scala
"com.softwaremill.diffx" %% "diffx-scalatest" % "0.3.15"
```

Then, extend the `com.softwaremill.diffx.scalatest.DiffMatcher` trait or `import com.softwaremill.diffx.scalatest.DiffMatcher._`.
After that you will be able to use syntax such as:

```scala
left should matchTo(right)
```

Giving you nice error messages:

## Specs2 integration

To use with specs2, add the following dependency:

```scala
"com.softwaremill.diffx" %% "diffx-specs2" % "0.3.15"
```

Then, extend the `com.softwaremill.diffx.specs2.DiffMatcher` trait or `import com.softwaremill.diffx.specs2.DiffMatcher._`.
After that you will be able to use syntax such as:

```scala
left must matchTo(right)
```

## ZIO Test integration

To use with [ZIO Test](https://zio.dev/docs/usecases/usecases_testing), add the following dependency:

```scala
"com.softwaremill.diffx" %% "diffx-ziotest" % "0.3.15"
```

Then, extend the `com.softwaremill.diffx.ziotest.ZIODiffMatcher` trait or `import com.softwaremill.diffx.ziotest.ZIODiffMatcher._`.
After that you will be able to use syntax such as:

```scala
assertM(ZIO.effect(left), matchTo(right))
```

## Using directly

Add the following dependency:

```scala
"com.softwaremill.diffx" %% "diffx-core" % "0.3.15"
```

Then call:

```scala
import com.softwaremill.diffx.Diff

Diff[T].apply(o1, o2)
```

## Customization

If you'd like to implement custom matching logic for the given type, create an implicit `Diff` instance for that 
type, and make sure it's in scope when any any `Diff` instances depending on that type are created.

If there is already a typeclass for a particular type, but you would like to use another one, you wil have to override existing instance. Because of the "exporting" mechanism the top level typeclass is `Derived[Diff]` rather then `Diff` and that's the typeclass you need to override. 

To understand it better, consider following example with `NonEmptyList` from cats.
`NonEmptyList` is implemented as case class so diffx will create a `Derived[Diff[NonEmptyList]]` typeclass instance using magnolia derivation.

Obviously that's not what we usually want. In most of the cases we would like `NonEmptyList` to be compared as a list.
Diffx already has an instance of a typeclass for a list. One more thing to do is to use that typeclass by converting `NonEmptyList` to list which can be done using `contramap` method.

The final code looks as follows:

`implicit def nelDiff[T: Diff]: Derived[Diff[NonEmptyList[T]]] = Derived(Diff[List[T]].contramap[NonEmptyList[T]](_.toList))`


## Ignoring

Fields can be excluded from comparision by calling the `ignore` method on the `Diff` instance.
Since `Diff` instances are immutable, the `ignore` method creates a copy of the instance with modified logic.
You can use this instance explicitly.
If you still would like to use it implicitly, you first need to summon the instance of the `Diff` typeclass using
the `Derived` typeclass wrapper: `Derived[Diff[Person]]`. Thanks to that trick, later you will be able to put your modified
instance of the `Diff` typeclass into the implicit scope. The whole process looks as follows:

```scala
implicit modifiedDiff: Diff[Person] = Derived[Diff[Person]].ignore(_.name)
``` 

## Tagging support

To use with softwaremill-tagging library, add the following dependency:

```scala
"com.softwaremill.diffx" %% "diffx-tagging" % "0.3.15"
```

And then extend `com.softwaremill.diffx.tagging.DiffTaggingSupport` trait or `import com.softwaremill.diffx.tagging.DiffTaggingSupport._`

Diffx should be able to work with any other tagging library. I decided to create this module in order to check
if any future changes won't break this integration.

If you want to use diffx with other tagging library you need to provide a way for creating `Diff` type class for tagged types:
```scala
implicit def taggedDiff[T: Diff, U]: Derived[Diff[T @@ U]] = Derived(Diff[T].contramap[T @@ U](identity))
```

## Similar projects

There is a number of similar projects from which diffx draws inspiration.

Below is a list of some of them, which I am aware of, with their main differences:
- [xotai/diff](https://github.com/xdotai/diff) - based on shapeless, seems not to be activly developed anymore
- [ratatool-diffy](https://github.com/spotify/ratatool/tree/master/ratatool-diffy) - the main purpose is to compare large data sets stored on gs or hdfs
